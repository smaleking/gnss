Abandon the idea of adding more taps. Delete the branch multiple taps. The current implementation has intrinsic limitations of adding new taps.

Work on bit sync. It should be run inside tracking loop.

1. add Bits and BitFlipCnt[20]; initialize them
2. add tracking state
	1. pulling
	2. bit-sync

1 frame = 5 subframes 
1 subframe = 10 words 
1 word  = 30 bits = 6s
Subframe 1, 2, 3 consists of the ephemeris and clock information
Subframe 4, 5 are almanac
The first 2 words of each subframe are always TLW and HOW.

The first 8 bits of TLW is 0x8b or 0x74, used for sub-frame sync.
The second word is HOW. It contains Z-count and subframe number(0-4).

frame sync has to satisfy 3 requirement
1. found preamble in the subframe
2. found preamble in next subframe
3. TOW_next = TOW_curr + 1; Need to consider roll-over problem (100799 and then 0).


To do frame sync, we save two subframes, 20 words.
